      "Hello! I'm a passionate full-stack developer with strong expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and modern frontend technologies. I love building fast, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces using React and Next.js, along with styling tools like Tailwind CSS and CSS3.",
      "My experience spans across the full MERN ecosystem—ranging from creating clean and dynamic frontends to designing efficient REST APIs and managing database workflows with MongoDB and Node/Express. I enjoy working on both frontend experiences and backend logic to deliver complete, functional applications.",
      "Alongside my MERN and frontend background, I'm currently working with backend development in Go (Golang) and exploring cloud technologies. This includes learning server-side architecture, deployment workflows, and improving my understanding of scalable cloud environments.",
      "I'm always eager to learn, explore new tools, and push my skills further through real-world projects. My goal is to keep growing as a full-stack and cloud-focused developer while building meaningful and impactful software."
